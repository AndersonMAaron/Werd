# Developer Notes

## Module Responsibility

* Werd::Dictionary (remember, Class is a Module!)
** loads words from a text file and stores in hash (for lookup speeds)
** methods that deal with evaluating the entire dictionary

* Werd::Util
** methods that deal with individual words and parsing thereof

* Werd::Solver
** module containing classes for individual problem solving involving words
